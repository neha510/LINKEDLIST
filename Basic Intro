Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
  Dynamic Array.
  Ease of Insertion/Deletion.


Drawbacks of Linked Lists: 

 1. Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node(head node). So we cannot do a binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
 2. Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
 3. Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.
